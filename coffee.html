        <h3>Coffee Recommendations</h3>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            <p>
            I like coffee, especially cappuccinos. My friend Justine has a <a href="http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html">fantastic list</a> of good coffeeshops in a few places around the world; read her list too. Also, thanks to the other members of my coffee committee, <a href="https://deeptir.me/">Deepti</a>, <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~apanda/">Panda</a>, <a href="http://www.racheesingh.com/">Rachee</a>, <a href="https://sagark.org">Sagar</a>, and <a href="https://shoumik.xyz/">Shoumik</a> for their suggestions!
            </p>

            <p>
            Note: When it comes to coffee, I mostly evaluate cappuccinos. For pedants, this page additionally contains recommendations for non-coffee items.

        <h4>Boston/Cambridge</h4>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.ogawacoffeeusa.com/">Ogawa Coffee</a> is the best Boston cappuccino I've had thus far (as an added bonus, the baristas make elaborate latte art designs). <a href="http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/the-godfrey-hotel/">George Howell Coffee</a> is also great: the flavor is well balanced, and the baristas pour excellently.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.1369coffeehouse.com/?page_id=172">1369 Coffee</a>, and <a href="http://www.barismo.com/">Barismo</a> are good options in Cambridge. There's also now a <a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/cafes#boston">Blue Bottle</a> (Blue Bottle cappucinos are on the acidic side; I get the cafe latte instead).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://areafour.com/locations/a4-cafe/">Area Four</a> has the best cappuccino near the Stata Center. <a href="http://mamalehs.com/">Mamaleh's</a> is also good, and has decent bagels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://flatblackcoffee.com/">Flat Black</a>, near Downtown, is operated by Australians and thus has flat whites; <a href="https://pavementcoffeehouse.com/">Pavement</a> is a good option if you're in Back Bay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.kungfutea.com/">Kung Fu Tea</a> is a boba chain with a few locations in the Boston area. It's not as good as Asha (see below), but it's decent. 
                    <a href="http://www.tealuxe.com/">Tealuxe</a>'s boba is not my favorite, but they make a decent masala chai. They also have a good loose-leaf selection.

                <li>
                    The old favorite near Soda Hall, Nefeli Cafe, is now closed. Instead, <a href="https://yaliscoffee.com/">Yali's in Sutardja Dai Hall</a> is a good option. Don't get a small iced coffee here: these are apparently bad.
                </li>

                    <a href="https://www.highwirecoffee.com/">Highwire</a> and <a href="https://www.artiscoffee.com/">Artis</a> are good options if you've just had lunch at <a href="http://vikschaat.com/">Vik's</a> (or are otherwise near the Fourth Street Area).

                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.philzcoffee.com/locations">Philz</a> is good at non-espresso coffee. There are several locations, including in the South Bay. Their Shattuck Ave. location is now closed. <a href="https://sagark.org/assets/static/coffee.html">People</a> are sad about this.

                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.ashateahouse.com/pages/locations">Asha</a> is, as far as I'm concerned, the One True Boba Place.

                    <a href="https://www.dandelionchocolate.com/">Dandelion Chocolate</a> may have chocolate in its name, but they serve great mochas! I recommend the Mission Hot Chocolate or Mission Mocha (they use <a href="https://www.fourbarrelcoffee.com/">Four Barrel</a> beans).

                    <a href="https://www.coffeebar.com/pages/locations#menlo">Coffeebar</a>, in nearby Menlo Park, is also a great option. If you avoid dairy, their oat milk iced latte is good.

                    <a href="http://chromatic.cafe/">Chromatic</a>, at Lawrence and Stevens Creek (Cupertino), has flat whites. Their cappuccino is too acidic; get the latte.

                    <a href="https://www.devoutcoffee.com/">Devout</a> is a decent option in Fremont.

                    <a href="http://www.lamarzoccousa.com/locations/">La Marzocco Cafe</a> is unique: it serves as a showcase for La Marzocco equipment, and therefore features a rotating selection of roasters. It's colocated with the KEXP radio studio at the Seattle Center, so there's great music.
                </li>

                    I'm writing this from <a href="http://floretseattle.com/">Floret</a>, in SeaTac Airport near the A gates, which has Stumptown beans and a La Marzocco espresso machine and surprisingly good coffee for an airport. It's also a great option for vegetarian food at the airport.
