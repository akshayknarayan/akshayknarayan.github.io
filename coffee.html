        <h3>Coffeeshop Recommendations</h3>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            <p>
            I like coffee, especially cappuccinos. My friend Justine has a <a href="http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html">fantastic list</a> of good coffeeshops in a few places around the world; read her list too.
            </p>

            <p>
            Note: When it comes to coffee, I mostly evaluate cappuccinos.

                    <a href="http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/the-godfrey-hotel/">George Howell Coffee</a> is the best Boston cappuccino I've had thus far. The flavor is well balanced, and the baristas pour excellently.

                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.1369coffeehouse.com/?page_id=172">1369 Coffee</a>, <a href="https://www.cremacambridge.com/">Crema Cafe</a>, and <a href="http://www.barismo.com/">Barismo</a> are good options in Cambridge. Crema uses George Howell beans and is also a good lunch spot.

                    <a href="https://www.kungfutea.com/">Kung Fu Tea</a> is a boba chain with a few locations in the Boston area. It's not as good as Asha (see below), but it's decent. 
                    <a href="http://www.tealuxe.com/">Tealuxe</a>'s boba is not my favorite, but they make a decent masala chai. They also have a good loose-leaf selection.
