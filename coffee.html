        <h3>Coffeeshop Recommendations</h3>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            <p>
            I like coffee, especially cappuccinos. My friend Justine has a <a href="http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html">fantastic list</a> of good coffeeshops in a few places around the world.
            I won't quibble with her recommendations except to append a South Bay recommendation for <a href="http://chromatic.cafe/">Chromatic</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            Note: When it comes to coffee, I only evaluate cappuccinos.

        <h4>Boston/Cambridge</h4>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/the-godfrey-hotel/">George Howell Coffee</a> is the best Boston cappuccino I've had thus far. The flavor is well balanced, and the baristas pour excellently. This place is on the same level as Blue Bottle or Four Barrell in SF.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.1369coffeehouse.com/?page_id=172">1369 Coffee</a> and <a href="https://www.cremacambridge.com/">Crema Cafe</a> are good options in Cambridge. Crema uses George Howell beans and is also a good lunch spot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://areafour.com/locations/a4-cafe/">Area Four</a> has the best cappuccino near the Stata Center.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://flatblackcoffee.com/">Flat Black</a>, near Downtown, is operated by Australians and thus has flat whites; <a href="https://pavementcoffeehouse.com/">Pavement</a> is a good option if you're in Back Bay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.tealuxe.com/">Tealuxe</a> is good for tea. Sadly (much like the rest of the East Coast) their boba is terrible, but they make a decent masala chai. They also have an exhaustive loose-leaf selection.
