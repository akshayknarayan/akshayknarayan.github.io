        <h3>Coffee Recommendations</h3>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            <p>
            I like coffee, especially cappuccinos. My friend Justine has a <a href="http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html">fantastic list</a> of good coffeeshops in a few places around the world; read her list too. Also, thanks to the other members of my coffee committee, <a href="https://deeptir.me/">Deepti</a>, <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~apanda/">Panda</a>, <a href="http://www.racheesingh.com/">Rachee</a>, <a href="https://sagark.org">Sagar</a>, and <a href="https://shoumik.xyz/">Shoumik</a> for their suggestions!
            </p>

            <p>
            Note: When it comes to coffee, I mostly evaluate cappuccinos. This page primarily has recommendations for small and independent coffeeshops; if instead you want inexpensive or mass-market coffee, it's not hard to find. For pedants, this page additionally contains recommendations for non-coffee items.

                    <a href="https://www.ogawacoffeeusa.com/">Ogawa Coffee</a> is the best Boston cappuccino I've had thus far (as an added bonus, the baristas make elaborate latte art designs). <a href="http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/the-godfrey-hotel/">George Howell Coffee</a> is also great: the flavor is well balanced, and the baristas pour excellently.

        <h4>Italy</h4>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            <p>
            Note: Italian coffee culture is somewhat different than the other places on this page. For example, Italians don't drink heated-milk drinks such as cappucinos after 11:00. Also, the standard price one should expect for an espresso is €1, and a cappuccino should be €1.50 (this is when standing at the bar; table service is more expensive). If the place is charging more than this, you either have no other option or are rich (airports, fancy hotels, etc).
            As a result, my recommendation is a cappuccino in the morning and a cafe macchiato (espresso with a bit of foamy milk) in the afternoon. Italian espresso is much more drinkable than most other places on this list, so this plan wasn't an issue for me. You can still request milk drinks in the afternoon, but be prepared for some eye-rolling. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Also, I have only listed the places that especially stood out to me in some way. It is in almost all cases perfectly fine to walk into an arbitrary "caffetteria" for coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
            Now, my actual recommendations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In Milan, I enjoyed "La Caffetteria" ("coffee shop") at <a href="https://www.mercatocentrale.it/milano/">Mercato Centrale</a>, which is attached to Milano Centrale railway station. They also have good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_bun">"Maritozzi"</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Florence, I liked <a href="https://www.caffegilli.com/">Cafe Gilli</a>, which is an existence proof that even fancy cafes ("since 1733") adhere to standard Italian espresso pricing.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/my-little-cup-montr%C3%A9al">My Little Cup</a> is inside the McGill metro station (where else in North America will you find this nice a cafe inside a metro station??). Their <i>pain au chocolat</i> is also delightful.

        <h4>Mumbai</h4>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            Note: Indians mostly drink filter coffee. You can get this basically anywhere, so this list focuses on fancier and more westernized (i.e., cappuccino) places.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://kcroasters.com/pages/visit">KC Roasters</a> in Bandra is the best cappuccino I have had in Mumbai.

                    <a href="https://bluetokaicoffee.com/pages/our-cafes">Blue Tokai</a> is a good default option, with cafes in a few cities around India. There are six Mumbai locations.

                    In Kala Ghoda, <a href="http://kgcafe.in/">Kala Ghoda Cafe</a> has good lunch options as well as coffee.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In Churchgate, where there used to be the long-running Tea Centre, there is now Queen's Deck (neither has a website I can link to). I have visited the Queen's Deck incarnation and can say the tea is good (especially the Assam selections), but I am told it's not quite as good as the old version, especially in the food department. I didn't like the pre-mixed chai; get a black tea and add the milk yourself.
