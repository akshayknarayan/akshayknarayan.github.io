        <h3>Coffee Recommendations</h3>
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block">
            <p>
            I like coffee, especially cappuccinos. My friend Justine has a <a href="http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html">fantastic list</a> of good coffeeshops in a few places around the world; read her list too. Also, thanks to the other members of my coffee committee, <a href="https://deeptir.me/">Deepti</a>, <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~apanda/">Panda</a>, <a href="http://www.racheesingh.com/">Rachee</a>, <a href="https://sagark.org">Sagar</a>, and <a href="https://shoumik.xyz/">Shoumik</a> for their suggestions!
            </p>

            <p>
            Note: When it comes to coffee, I mostly evaluate cappuccinos. For pedants, this page additionally contains recommendations for non-coffee items.

                    <a href="https://www.ogawacoffeeusa.com/">Ogawa Coffee</a> is the best Boston cappuccino I've had thus far (as an added bonus, the baristas make elaborate latte art designs). <a href="http://www.georgehowellcoffee.com/the-godfrey-hotel/">George Howell Coffee</a> is also great: the flavor is well balanced, and the baristas pour excellently. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://bakeybabka.com/">Bakey</a> is a bakery + coffee shop. They have good pastries, especially babka, but their coffee is a first-class part of the shop (their roaster is Seattle's <a href="https://caffeumbria.com/pages/our-cafes">Caffe Umbria</a>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://www.barismo.com/">Barismo</a> and <a href="https://www.broadsheetcoffee.com/">Broadsheet</a> are good options in Cambridge. There's also now a <a href="https://bluebottlecoffee.com/cafes#boston">Blue Bottle</a> (Blue Bottle cappucinos are on the acidic side; when I go (rarely), I get the cafe latte instead).

                    <a href="https://flatblackcoffee.com/">Flat Black</a>, near Downtown, is operated by Australians and thus has flat whites; <a href="https://pavementcoffeehouse.com/">Pavement</a> is a good option if you're in Back Bay (there is now also a Pavement location in Harvard Square, in the student center).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Old recommendations Crema and Tealuxe in Harvard Square <a href="https://boston.eater.com/2018/12/10/18134409/tealuxe-closing-harvard-square-cambridge">are now gone</a>; Crema has been replaced with a more expensive place called "Bluestone Lane" (I haven't been).

            Note: Indians mostly drink filter coffee. You can get this basically anywhere, so this list focuses on fancier and more westernized (i.e., cappuccino) places.

                    <a href="https://kcroasters.com/pages/visit">KC Roasters</a> in Bandra is the best cappuccino I have had in Mumbai.

                    In Churchgate, where there used to be the long-running Tea Centre, there is now Queen's Deck (neither has a website I can link to). I have visited the Queen's Deck incarnation and can say the tea is good (especially the Assam selections), but I am told it's not quite as good as the old version, especially in the food department. I didn't like the pre-mixed chai; get a black tea and add the milk yourself.
