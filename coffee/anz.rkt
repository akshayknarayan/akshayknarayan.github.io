      Much like in Italy, Australia's base level of coffee quality is generally higher than what one is used to. 
      In Melbourne and Sydney especially, any arbitrary cafe will generally have good espresso.  The local drink is the flat white, which is like a slightly less foamy cappuccino.  
      I really do mean arbitrary; 
      places with (perhaps unexpectedly) good flat whites have been a laundromat, 
      a fast food Mexican restaurant in a strip mall, 
      and a mall food court.

      Meanwhile, while the base level is generally good, the peak is not much higher; 
      don't expect fancy third-wave coffee with tasting notes.

      New Zealand coffeeshops are not as universally good;
